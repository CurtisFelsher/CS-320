How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
By using multiple methods of testing such as junit tests, along with other methods such as peer-review, software can be checked multiple times over to ensure there are as little flaws as possible. These types of testing also help with developer bias and can catch things that the developer could never imagine that an end user could do.


How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
I like the approach that agile uses by keeping user needs and the clientâ€™s needs in check throughout the entire development process. This can help narrow down user requests to understand what is being sought after in a clearer view. 


How do I approach designing software?
Designing software is pretty complex. Taking into account exactly what the client is looking for along with planning ahead, can help in avoiding any road bumps that may spring up. Software testing also ensures that the program you are developing is within spec and executes tasks without flaw.
